## rain

as observed by multiple people, whenever you are planning to do outdoor stuff in oslo on the weekend - it always seems to rain. so does it really rain more on the weekends? 

here is SeNorge precipitation data from (Lussana et al., 2019) groped by weekday to answer this question (and probably adjust cycling and climbing planning routine?)
